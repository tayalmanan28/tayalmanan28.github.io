<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! I am Manan, a Researcher working on problems at the intersection of Control, Optimization and Machine Learning, with a focus on safety enforced decision-making in dynamical systems. Developing methods that integrate learning with formal guarantees to ensure constraint satisfaction and robust performance in uncertain, data-driven environments.

I am PhD Scholar at <a href='https://cps.iisc.ac.in/'>Centre for Cyber Physical Systems</a>, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, working on Safe Robot Learning in the <a href='http://www.stochlab.com/'>Stochastic Robotics Lab</a> under the guidance of <a href='https://www.shishirny.com/'>Prof. Shishir N. Y. Kolathaya</a> and <a href="https://www.pushpakjagtap.com/"> Prof. Pushpak Jagtap.

I am actively collaborating with <a href="https://smlbansal.github.io/"> Prof. Somil Bansal </a> at Stanford University and <a href="https://awclark587.wixsite.com/mysite"> Prof. Andrew Clark</a> at Washington University.

I completed my B.Tech from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) in 2021.
