    <h2 class="mb-4">Collaborations</h2>
    <p>
      I work on robotics, learning-based control, and safe autonomy — with interests spanning both academic research and real-world applications. 
      I collaborate with students and researchers as part of the 
      <a href="https://www.stochlab.com/" target="_blank">Stochastic Robotics Lab</a> at IISc Bangalore, 
      and explore applied consulting opportunities under <a href="https://tau-intelligence.com/">TAU Intelligence</a>, which stands for Trusted Autonomy in Uncertain Environments.

    <h3 class="mt-5">🎓 Academic Collaborations</h3>

    <h4 class="mt-4">📘 Internships & Research Assistantships</h4>
    <p>
      I’m looking to work with motivated interns and research assistants (preferably for 6 months or more) on problems at the intersection of safe control and robot learning. Some of the current directions include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Safety-critical control of autonomous systems using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability</li>
      <li>Reinforcement learning for control of ground vehicles, drones, manipulators, and legged robots</li>
      <li>Trajectory optimization and setting up scalable simulation environments for robotics research</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These collaborations often begin through informal discussions or small research tasks, and may evolve into long-term projects. If you're interested in working on these topics, feel free to email me or explore open opportunities on the lab website:

    <h4 class="mt-4">🎓 Thesis Guidance</h4>
    <p>
      I’ve mentored students working on B.Tech and M.Tech thesis projects relevant to my research areas. If you are a student looking for guidance on above mentioned topics, feel free to reach out.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">🤝 Informal Mentorship</h4>
    <p>
      I’m happy to support early-stage students through paper discussions, project direction, or code reviews — especially if you're starting out in robotics or preparing for graduate school.
    </p>

    <!-- Consulting Section -->
    <h3 class="mt-5">🚀 Applied Collaborations (via TAU Intelligence)</h3>

    <p>
      I am currently exploring opportunities to collaborate with AI and robotics organizations or startups that seek support in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing robust controllers for robotic systems tailored to specific application needs</li>
      <li>Setting up simulation testbeds (e.g., MuJoCo, Isaac Gym, PyBullet) for safe policy learning and benchmarking</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While I am in the early stages of formal consulting, I bring experience from various collaborative research projects, internships, and hands-on work in controller synthesis, optimization, and simulation pipelines. For more details, please visit the TAU Intelligence website:
