    <h2 class="mb-4">Work With Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a PhD student at the <strong>Stochastic Robotics Lab, IISc Bangalore</strong>, where I work on safe control, learning-based planning, and robotics. I’m always excited to connect with curious and motivated students who are interested in research collaborations, internships, or thesis work.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">📘 Research Internships & Projects</h4>
    <p>
      I regularly mentor undergraduate and master’s students on research projects related to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and safe control design</li>
      <li>Reinforcement learning in safety-critical robotics</li>
      <li>Trajectory optimization, locomotion, and simulation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These projects are ideal for students looking to gain research experience, contribute to open-source tools, or explore graduate-level topics hands-on. Most collaborations begin remotely and can optionally lead to in-person visits.

    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">🎓 B.Tech / M.Tech Thesis Mentoring</h4>
    <p>
      If you're working on a final-year project in control, robotics, or machine learning, I’d be happy to co-mentor or provide feedback — especially if your project aligns with my research.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve previously co-advised students on topics like safe UAV control, bipedal locomotion, and simulation toolchains (e.g., PyBullet, Isaac Gym).
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">🤝 Collaboration & Guidance</h4>
    <p>
      I’m happy to offer informal mentoring, reading group discussions, or code reviews for students who are just beginning in this field. If you're preparing for grad school, want help navigating papers, or need project direction, feel free to reach out.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">📩 Reach Out</h4>
    <p>
      I don't formally admit students — but I’m always open to collaboration. If you're excited about robotics, safe learning, or control theory, and are willing to put in the work, I’d love to hear from you!
